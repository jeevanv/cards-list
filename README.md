To start application, run below commands: 
1. npm install
2. npm start (this will build the app and starts the server)
3. app will be running at http://localhost:3000

other instructions:
- tested app in Chrome ver 69
- node version 8.12.0, npm 6.4.1

note: I included the bundled js file just in case if you don't prefer to build

Thank you,
